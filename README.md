# gmStudioCfg

Using gmStudio configuration files to experiment with GitHub.

There are three types of configuration files distributed with gmStudio:

* [Metalang files](https://github.com/mjuras/gmStudioCfg/tree/master/Metalang) that direct the standard operation of the translation engine.  These files are required for operating the translator.
* [Settings files](https://github.com/mjuras/gmStudioCfg/tree/master/Settings) that direct the gmStudo IDE.  Most of these files are required for typical operation of the Studio and others are only needed for special tasks.
* [Rules files](https://github.com/mjuras/gmStudioCfg/tree/master/Rules) that direct custom operation of the translation engine.  These files are samples of migration rules and special scripts developed and used in various upgrade projects.  There are files reflecting both old and new conventions. 

These files should not be used with the latest version of gmStudio, please contact Great Migrations with questions.
